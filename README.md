# Leave Joe Mauer a Message

Inspired by [the LeBron voicemail commercial](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yVr1_ThJ_c), this is an answering machine app that lets fans leave messages and well wishes for Joe Mauer, first baseman for the Minnesota Twins. This application was built using the [Twilio APIs for voice and text messages](http://www.twilio.com).

Call or text *(612) 255-4563* to leave Joe a message and wish him well! See your anonymous message (and everyone else's) at [leavejoeamessage.com](http://leavejoeamessage.com).  It will take a while for your message to be approved and displayed, as we want to make sure to filter out any naughty language.

## Contact

For any questions or inquiries about this application, contact [Kevin Whinnery at Twilio](mailto:kw@twilio.com).
